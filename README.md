# Integrated Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Transaction Risk Management Platform

## **Overview**
This repository showcases a comprehensive AML and transaction risk management platform I developed to enhance financial compliance. The platform integrates **real-time transaction monitoring**, **fraud detection**, **customer profiling**, **compliance tracking**, and **bank risk analysis**. Using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**, I processed data, applied rule-based fraud detection, visualized risks, and tracked performance with key KPIs.

## **Accomplishments**
### **1. Data Integration and Feature Engineering**
- Consolidated transaction, customer, and bank data into a relational database using SQL.
- Cleaned and prepared datasets by handling missing values, deduplicating records, and standardizing formats.
- Engineered key features such as transaction frequency, average transaction amount, and high-risk indicators.
- Defined KPIs for data quality, ensuring high standards for completeness and consistency.

### **2. Real-Time Transaction Risk Monitoring**
- Created an interactive dashboard in **Tableau** to visualize transaction data by region.
- Designed map-based visualizations with dynamic filters for transaction type, date range, and risk levels.
- Highlighted high-risk regions using color-coded risk indicators, enabling quick identification of potential hotspots.
- Monitored KPIs such as high-risk region count, average transaction amounts, and alert timeliness.

### **3. Rule-Based Fraud Detection**
- Implemented a rule-based system using **SQL** and automated it with **Python** scripts to flag suspicious transactions.
- Developed rules with AML experts to detect fraud patterns (e.g., large single transactions, high-frequency transactions, or activities in high-risk regions).
- Automated fraud detection and alert generation, outputting detailed reports summarizing flagged transactions.
- Tracked KPIs like flagged transaction count, false positive rate, and detection accuracy to evaluate system performance.

### **4. Customer Risk Profiling**
- Built a risk profiling system by analyzing customer transaction patterns and computing composite risk scores in SQL.
- Segmented customers into low, medium, and high-risk groups and visualized these segments in **Tableau**.
- Provided compliance teams with clear, color-coded insights to monitor high-risk individuals.
- Achieved accurate segmentation by ensuring completeness and correctness of risk indicators.
